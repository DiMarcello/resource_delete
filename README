ResourceDelete
==============

This plugin adds an delete action with method get to each resource route.
Since the standard Rails way to delete a resource is obtrusive javascript,
and a good website should also be accessed without javascript.

A good way to implement this action is to write a form with a message
like "Are you sure?" and submit buttons "Yes" and "No", with the first
destroying the record, and the second redirecting to the referring page.

Example
=======

The plugin adds a delete action by default:
  map.resources :pirates # /pirates/1/delete
  map.resource :pirate # /pirate/delete

To override this behaviour you should add delete to the except option:
  map.resources :pirates, :except => [:delete]
