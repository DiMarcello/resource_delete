== ResourceDelete

This plugin adds an delete action with method get to each resource route.
This because the standard Rails way to delete a resource is through obtrusive javascript,
and a good website should also be accessed without javascript.

A good way to implement this action is to write a form with a message
like "Are you sure?" and submit buttons "Yes" and "No", with the first
destroying the record, and the second redirecting to the referring page.

== Example

The plugin adds a delete action by default:
  map.resources :pirates # /pirates/1/delete
  map.resource :pirate # /pirate/delete

To override this behaviour you should add delete to the except option:
  map.resources :pirates, :except => [:delete]
  
View (delete.html.erb)
  <%- form_for @object, :url => {:action => :destroy} do |form| -%>
    "Are you sure?"
    <%= form.submit "Yes" %>
    <%= form.submit "No", :name => 'cancel' %>
  <%- end -%>

Controller
  def destroy
    if params[:object][:cancel]
      redirect_to :action => :show
    else
      @object.destroy
    end
  end

== Todo

Write a form_for_delete to auto add the delete method to the form, just
for conveniance sake.
